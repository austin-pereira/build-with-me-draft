# Build with Me – Draft Notes

Welcome to the early notes and drafts for **Build with Me** — a direct, story-driven book that explores creative problem-solving through the eyes of the customer.

This book isn’t about me. It’s about the builders, dreamers, and curious minds who don’t want to just watch from the sidelines. It’s about understanding problems as **customers feel them** — and turning that empathy into something real.

## What This Repo Is
- **In Development:** These are raw, evolving notes. They’re not final. They’re pieces of a story I’m still learning to tell.
- **Open to Feedback:** I’m sharing this to find like-minded people who care about making things better for customers. Your insights, questions, and suggestions are welcome.
- **A Step Towards Audiobook:** Eventually, these notes will become an audiobook — something people can listen to in quiet moments, a reminder that the best solutions start with listening.

## Why "Build with Me"?
Too many times, we build things **for** customers without actually understanding them. This book is a reminder that the best ideas are built **with** people — with their frustrations, their hopes, and their voices.

These notes are my way of learning from every story, every stumble, and every problem that matters. And I hope they’ll help you build too.
