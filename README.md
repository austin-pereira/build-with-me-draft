# Build with Me – Draft Notes

Welcome to the early notes and drafts for **Build with Me** — a direct, story-driven book and open-source journal that explores creative problem-solving through the eyes of the customer.

This book isn’t about me. It’s about the **builders, dreamers, and doers** who don’t want to just watch from the sidelines. It’s about understanding problems as customers feel them — and turning that empathy into action.

## 📘 What This Repo Is

- **In Development**: These are raw, evolving notes. They’re not final. They’re pieces of a story I’m still learning to tell.
- **Open to Feedback**: I’m sharing this to find like-minded people who care about making things better for others. Your insights, questions, and suggestions are always welcome.
- **A Step Toward an Audiobook**: Eventually, these daily reflections will evolve into an audiobook — something builders can listen to during their own quiet moments.

## 🚀 Why “Build with Me”?

Too often, we build things *for* customers without ever building *with* them. This book is a reminder that the best ideas come from the ground up — through listening, learning, testing, and empathizing. It’s about building things that matter, not just things that work.

These notes are my way of learning from every story, every stumble, and every problem that really matters. And I hope they’ll help you build too.

## 🧠 Who This Is For

This is for the **future entrepreneur** — especially young builders navigating a world led by AI, shifting economies, and untapped opportunities. Whether you're still in school or starting your first project, this is a space for you.

The long-term goal of this project is to create a **modern builder’s education** — like a new form of “king’s education,” where entrepreneurs who’ve made successful exits mentor the next generation.

We’ll be compiling not just notes, but resources, mentorship, and real examples of how $100M+ projects are started — from idea to execution.
