# Build with Me â€“ Draft Notes

Welcome to the early notes and drafts for **Build with Me** â€” a direct, story-driven book that explores creative problem-solving through the eyes of the customer.

This book isnâ€™t about me. Itâ€™s about the builders, dreamers, and curious minds who donâ€™t want to just watch from the sidelines. Itâ€™s about understanding problems as **customers feel them** â€” and turning that empathy into something real.

## What This Repo Is
- **In Development:** These are raw, evolving notes. Theyâ€™re not final. Theyâ€™re pieces of a story Iâ€™m still learning to tell.
- **Open to Feedback:** Iâ€™m sharing this to find like-minded people who care about making things better for customers. Your insights, questions, and suggestions are welcome.
- **A Step Towards Audiobook:** Eventually, these notes will become an audiobook â€” something people can listen to in quiet moments, a reminder that the best solutions start with listening.

## Why "Build with Me"?
Too many times, we build things **for** customers without actually understanding them. This book is a reminder that the best ideas are built **with** people â€” with their frustrations, their hopes, and their voices.

These notes are my way of learning from every story, every stumble, and every problem that matters. And I hope theyâ€™ll help you build too.
