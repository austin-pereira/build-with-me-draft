Day 2: The Industry

Today, I realized there’s so much the economy has to offer. If you’re problem-solving oriented, the more problems you solve for the customer, the more traction you’ll get. If you’re customer-focused, you’ll end up creating an astounding product.

I’m focusing on two things today:
1️⃣ Learning more about the businesses in the eldercare space — because that’s going to be my niche for the next 20 years. I’m determined to reshape the landscape with AI.
2️⃣ Breaking down this huge problem into smaller, manageable chunks.

I’m using AI heavily in my research, and I have an idea of where I’m going to enter this space. My goal is to change how people experience and perceive end-of-life planning — to make it more human and relevant.

Over the past three weeks, I’ve been reading market growth numbers, economic papers, and studying what others are doing to dominate this space. I’ve also sketched out three product ideas that I believe can truly transform this industry.

Some people ask where this idea came from. It started during a dinner with someone who told me that older people often don’t have anyone to help them with end-of-life planning. That resonated with me — not because it’s just a good market, but because it’s a real problem that needs to be solved. That’s what entrepreneurship means to me: solving tough problems in a cluttered and messy environment.

I’ve come to realize that being an entrepreneur isn’t about selling ice cream — it’s about selling health-conscious ice cream like keto or lactose-free options that solve real needs. It took me four years to get the meaning right. I hope this journey makes it easier for you.
