Day 2:
Thoughts:
Today I realized there’s so much the economy has to offer if you’re willing to see it through the customer’s lens. Being problem-solving oriented isn’t optional — it’s essential. The more problems you solve for the customer, the more traction you’re going to get.

Problems:
I’m grappling with how to break this massive eldercare problem into actionable chunks. It’s a huge challenge — how to bring AI to a space that’s been neglected for decades and make end-of-life planning more relevant and human.

New Insights:
I’ve been deep-diving into the eldercare space for three weeks now — looking at growth numbers, economic papers, and what others are doing to dominate the market. One big insight is that people need help navigating this space personally, not just with generic solutions.

Actions:

Keep using AI to break down the market into smaller segments and find a strong pivot point.

Refine the three product ideas I’m working on so they’re grounded in real customer needs, not just tech novelty.

Remember: entrepreneurship isn’t about selling ice cream. It’s about selling health-conscious ice cream that meets a real need — and it took me four years to figure that out.
