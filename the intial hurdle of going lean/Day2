**Thoughts:**  
Today I’m focused on the idea that the economy is full of opportunities — but only for those who are willing to see problems from the customer’s eyes. If you’re serious about building, you can’t just sit on ideas. You need to break down the problem and start **taking action**.

**Problems:**  
The eldercare space is a huge challenge. It’s slow, emotional, and most people avoid it. But that’s exactly why it matters — it’s neglected and underserved. The big question is: **how do I break it down and find my entry point?**

**New Insights:**  
I’ve realized that most people don’t want to touch this space because it’s not “sexy.” But I’m here because I believe in solving real problems, not chasing shiny objects.  
- The world is going to transfer its biggest wealth in 2048 — and this space is a key piece of that puzzle.  
- Customers don’t want more noise; they want real, human help.  
- I don’t have to have all the answers right away — I just need to **keep moving** and build from the ground up.

**Actions (Planned & Done):**  
✅ Research why this industry is still untouched and what’s stopping others.  
✅ Identify 3–5 entry points for AI in eldercare.  
✅ List out 10 eldercare businesses and how they operate today.  
🔲 Map out which part of this problem I resonate with most — and **where I want to focus my energy**.  
🔲 Start learning financial modeling — because I know I’m not great at it yet, and that’s part of the journey.
