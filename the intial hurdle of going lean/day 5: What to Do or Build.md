**Thoughts:**  
Today Iâ€™m focusing on **what to build**. Itâ€™s not about chasing trends or copying someone elseâ€™s idea â€” itâ€™s about being **self-aware** and finding the space that **connects** to me. Thatâ€™s the only way to make it real.

**Problems:**  
I keep coming back to the question: **How do I know whatâ€™s truly worth building?** Thereâ€™s so much noise out there â€” I donâ€™t want to build something just to be busy. I want to build something that **matters** to the people who use it.

**New Insights:**  
- The first step is **self-awareness** â€” understanding what space excites me and makes me feel alive.  
- Once I know that, I need to **go talk to customers** â€” listen to their real problems, write down the pain points, and dig deep into why no one else has solved it.  
- The core of what I believe:  
  ðŸ”² **Customer and problem first** â€” always.  
  ðŸ”² Ask: *Why are they facing this? What can I build to help?*  
  ðŸ”² Make a plan, execute it, and repeat.  
- This process doesnâ€™t just build great products â€” it **builds great teams and sparks innovation**.

**Actions (Planned & Done):**  
âœ… Take time to map out what spaces **resonate with me** â€” what problems Iâ€™m naturally drawn to.  
âœ… Reach out to potential customers â€” start conversations, not sales pitches.  
âœ… Write down every pain point I hear, even if it doesnâ€™t make sense at first.  
ðŸ”² Analyze why these problems are still unsolved â€” whatâ€™s missing?  
ðŸ”² Start sketching out how to **make the experience better** â€” and keep refining until itâ€™s real.

**References / Inspiration:**  
- My own journey â€” learning to trust my gut and **listen first, build second**.  
- Founders who turned listening into real innovation.  
- Notes from past customer interviews and market research.
