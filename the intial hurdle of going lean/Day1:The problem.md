**Day 1: The 100 Million Dollar Problem and Solution**

**Thoughts:**
I was at dinner with someone tonight, and it hit me — everyone’s building cool tech, but no one’s focusing on an important market: older people. We’re heading into a world dominated by an aging population, and it’s a problem no one’s really talking about. This isn’t a flashy market, but it’s real — and it’s been neglected.

**Problems:**
No one cares enough to help older people with end-of-life planning. It’s a trust- and emotion-heavy industry, and it can be daunting because it’s slow. But it’s also deeply rewarding.

**New Insights:**
I learned that the world is set to transfer its biggest wealth in 2048. If we don’t handle it properly, we’re going to miss a huge opportunity to help people — and leave them in a mess. This space is unsolved, full of mysteries, and there’s so much to explore.

**Actions:**

* Read about why this space is still untouched.
* Figure out how I can enter the market.
* Explore which parts of this problem resonate most with me.
* I’m not good at financial modeling yet — so I need to start learning it.
