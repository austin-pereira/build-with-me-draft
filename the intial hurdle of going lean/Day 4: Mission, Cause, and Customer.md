**Thoughts:**  
Great businesses arenâ€™t built on random ideas â€” theyâ€™re built on a mission thatâ€™s close to the founderâ€™s heart. A cause youâ€™d give up everything else for. When you find that cause, it doesnâ€™t feel like work â€” it feels like **purpose**.

**Problems:**  
Iâ€™m wrestling with the question: **whatâ€™s my cause?**  
How do I tie it to the real customer problems that matter? Because at the end of the day, great products donâ€™t come from theories â€” they come from people who care deeply about the person using them.

**New Insights:**  
- Great products are always **simple** â€” they solve real, basic problems and make life easier.  
- Customers donâ€™t care about my mission unless it **helps them** â€” so I need to start with their pain, not my idea.  
- The best businesses have missions that last **20â€“30 years** â€” theyâ€™re not trends, theyâ€™re commitments.

**Actions (Planned & Done):**  
âœ… Define what **my mission** really is â€” whatâ€™s the problem I want to spend 20 years solving?  
âœ… Identify **who my customers are** â€” whoâ€™s feeling this pain the most?  
âœ… Map out **the simplest way** to solve their problem â€” one product that makes a real difference.
