title: "Day 9: Study Your Customers Deeply"

**Thoughts:**  
Today is about **listening, not building**. If I want to serve people well, I need to **understand them deeply** — how they think, how they behave, what they need, and even what they’re afraid to ask for.

**Problems:**  
We often rush to build solutions without really knowing the people we’re trying to help. That’s how products fail — they don’t miss the tech, they miss the human.

**New Insights:**  
- The best way to improve **operational efficiency** isn’t a new tool — it’s knowing your customers better.  
- Every friction point in a system starts from **not understanding someone’s behavior** or expectation.  
- When you understand the customer, you can build an **ecosystem**, not just a product — because you’ll see where their journey starts, what slows them down, and what they really value.  
- Building around real people makes growth, retention, and service all easier.

**Actions (Planned & Done):**  
✅ Spend time reading behavioral studies and customer interviews in my target market (eldercare).  
✅ Identify the patterns — what are their habits, blockers, language, fears?  
✅ Start a doc titled “Know the Customer” — log insights every week.  
🔲 Interview 2–3 real people in the next two weeks and just **listen** — don’t pitch, don’t correct.  
🔲 Use this to refine not just product ideas, but the entire **user experience** from onboarding to support.

**References / Inspiration:**  
- Case studies of companies that built customer-first ecosystems (e.g. Amazon, Duolingo, Apple).  
- Behavioral design and service design resources.  
- Reminder to self: **You don’t build for users. You build with them.**
